Goal: Setup of lab to pass CKA certification

The purpose of this lab set up guide is to give individuals looking to get hands on experience with Kubernetes, a repeatable set up process for getting a multi node cluster stood up. This is not a production grade cluster and several of the steps involved in the setup would not be used in a real world environment.  This does however lower barriers of entry for those looking to understand and use Kubernetes in a local environment, without the use of cloud providers. 

Requirements:  Windows 10 system with account having administrator rights
